# Write strings classes with init if statments and variables in python.
Make a python string with print function by typing text only.
This program allows you to make a string with print function
just with text. Its most useful if you have alot of strings 
with print functions. Make all the strings you need copy and paste them
below your program cut and paste into program as needed.
To hide comments use the getpass one. I added another feature that
allows you to choose between on two or three quote strings.
classes were added on august 4 2022. A new feature with if statments with equality operator
was added on september 1 2022. This can be used to help learn a multimodal text editor
by copying code to it and cutting and pasting to were wanted. Variables were added on October 10 2002.
There is a option to use the input function with it. A new branch was created may 6 2023. Python syntax
C. I recomend using the python files but the c files work. 2 of the c files use different ways of flushing the input buffer. one uses fflush(stdin); the other fpurge(stdin);.Use whatever works on your
compiler. The third file will not clear the input buffer use it if the others wont work.
