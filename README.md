# Write strings classes with init if statments and variables in python.
Make a python string with print function by typing text only.
This program allows you to make a string with print function
just with text. Its most useful if you have alot of strings 
with print functions. Make all the strings you need copy and paste them
below your program cut and paste into program as needed. I added another feature that
allows you to choose between on two or three quote strings.

was added on september 1 2022. This can be used to help learn a multimodal text editor
